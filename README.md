## Calculator

Toy React Calculator for experimenting with CI/CD, AI agents, etc.

### Themes

The application supports multiple visual themes. Use the theme switcher at the
top right of the app to try them. Available themes are:

- **Default** – basic styling provided by `globals.css`.
- **Classic** – retro calculator colors.
- **Typewriter** – round keys with typewriter vibes.
- **Metal** – shiny metallic gradients.
- **Neon** – a fun, animated palette of bright neon colors.

### Modes

Use the mode toggle at the top right to switch between **classic** and **algebraic** modes. Algebraic mode shows extra parentheses buttons and lets you type expressions like `1-(2×3)` directly in the display. Evaluation of these algebraic expressions isn't implemented yet, so `=` currently does nothing in this mode.
