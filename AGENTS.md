# Instructions for Agents

- Consult `TODO.md` in the repository root to understand the current roadmap and pending tasks.
- When a task in `TODO.md` is finished, move it to the **Recently completed work** section of that file to keep the list up to date.
- Keep `README.md` updated with new features so users know how to use them.
